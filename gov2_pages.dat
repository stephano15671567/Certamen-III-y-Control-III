remember CHHS encourages practical and feasible energy saving measures while considering the health and safety of clients workers and family members Welcome to Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board The MRMIB was created in 1990 with a broad mandate to advise the Governor and the Legislature on strategies for reducing the number of uninsured persons in the state The Board is comprised of volunteer members appointed by the Governor and the Legislature Members serve four year terms The MRMIB is dedicated to improving the health of Californians by increasing access to affordable comprehensive quality health care coverage The MRMIB meets in public session usually on the fourth Wednesday of each month The MRMIB administers three health care programs They are The Access for Infants and Mothers AIM program provides low cost health insurance coverage to uninsured low income pregnant women and their infants AIM is part of California s efforts to increase health coverage of pregnant women and their infants The average subscriber is a married woman living in a household with a family income between 200 300 of the federal poverty level A pregnant woman and her infant s enrolled in AIM receive their care from one of nine health plans participating in the program The pregnant woman participates in the cost of her health care services through a low cost subscriber contribution The State of California supplements the subscriber contribution to cover the full cost of care AIM is funded from tobacco tax funds For an application Call toll free 1 800 433 2611 The Healthy Families Program HFP provides low cost health dental and vision coverage to uninsured children in low wage families Families participating in the program choose their health dental and vision plan Families pay premiums of 4 9 per child per month maximum of 27 per family to participate in the program The State and Federal government provide funding to the HFP For an application call toll free 1 888 747 1222 The Major Risk Medical Insurance Program MRMIP provides health insurance for Californians who are unable to obtain coverage in the individual health insurance market The majority of subscribers are between the ages of 40 64 and 58 are women People enroll in the program because they have been rejected for coverage by an insurance carrier or health plan due to a pre existing condition After 36 consecutive months in the program subscribers are required to leave MRMIP but they leave with a guarantee of coverage from plans selling coverage in the individual insurance market Services in the program are delivered through contracts with health insurance plans Californians qualifying for the program and for the guaranteed issue coverage that follows MRMIP coverage participate in the cost of their coverage by paying premiums The State of California supplements those premiums to cover the cost of care in MRMIP The State shares the cost of post MRMIP coverage with health plans that provide the coverage MRMIP s subsidy is funded from tobacco tax funds For an application call toll free 1 800 289 6574 The County Children s Health Initiative Program C CHIP provides low cost health coverage to uninsured children through age 19 not eligible for HFP or Medi Cal up to 300 of the Federal Income Guidelines When approved by CMS the program will allow counties and other entities to use local funds as a match to draw down unused federal State Children s Health Insurance Program SCHIP funds The counties will use these funds to provide health insurance to additional children using their locally sponsored health plans The program is managed by MRMIB and administered the county C CHIP provides benefits similar to HFP but serves children between 250 percent and 300 percent of the federal poverty level FPL Four pilot counties have implemented C CHIP and are waiting federal approval and another four counties are in the planning stages of their program This program is considered to be innovative in its manner of funding Usually federal funds require a State fund match before funds can be drawn down The C CHIP program when approved will allow counties to match available federal funds originally allocated to California but for which there was no State appropriated match These available federal funds along with county matched funds will provide needed services for children For further information call Janette Lopez at 916 327 6237 Pacific Health Advantage The Health Insurance Plan of California In addition to the above three programs the Board established in 1993 the State of California s Health Insurance Plan of California The HIPC The HIPC is the nation s pre eminent small employer purchasing pool The HIPC was successfully managed by the Board until

securely have never been greater Organizations having invested precious resources and scarce skills in various necessary security efforts such as risk analysis certification accreditation security architectures policy development and other security efforts can be tempted to neglect or insufficiently develop a comprehensive and systematic operational security testing program This guide stresses the need for an effective security testing program within federal agencies Testing serves several purposes One no matter how well a given system may have been developed the nature of today s complex systems with large volumes of code complex internal interactions interoperability with external components unknown interdependencies coupled with vendor cost and schedule pressures means that exploitable flaws will always be present and will surface over time Accordingly security testing must fill the gap between the state of system development as it is and actual operation of these systems Two security testing is important for understanding calibrating and documenting the operational Continued at ITL Bulletins page amp see complete list of all Computer Security ITL Bulletins

Co Chairs Susan Molinari and Richard Ravitch To obtain a copy of the report follow the instructions provided at the bottom of this page We have been honored to lead the Millennial Housing Commission during the past 17 months as we performed a thorough re examination of the federal role in meeting the nation 8217 s housing challenges at Congress 8217 request The 22 commissioners appointed to this task were drawn from across the country and from across the spectrum of housing ideologies and experience We are particularly pleased therefore to have achieved concurrence among all but one of the appointed members Click here to obtain a copy of the 8220 Dissenting Statement to the Report of the Millennial Housing Commission 8221 by Commissioner Robert Rector The Commission included former elected officials participants on previous national commissions housing researchers builders managers and owners planners and public administrators and leaders of community development organizations Our findings and recommendations obviously reflect the great diversity of philosophy and experience represented but on one thing we all agree 8212 we unequivocally care about housing and some fundamental precepts First housing matters It represents the single largest expenditure for most American families and the single largest source of wealth for most homeowners The development of housing has a major impact on the national economy and the economic growth and health of regions and communities Housing is inextricably linked to access to jobs and healthy communities and the social behavior of the families who occupy it The failure to achieve adequate housing leads to significant societal costs Second there is simply not enough affordable housing The inadequacy of supply increases dramatically as one moves down the ladder of family earnings The challenge is most acute for rental housing in high cost areas and the most egregious problem is for the very poor We recognize that our country is engaged in a war that affects our vital interests and that we have experienced a serious economic downturn from which we are entering a tentative recovery There is a serious public debate as to which tax and spending policies will best support the sound fiscal management that our nation requires Even within this context resources for affordable housing provide important economic social and societal benefits The inexorable growth in the numbers of families of those working in service sectors and of immigrants seeking to take part in the American Dream 8212 coupled with community opposition to high density development the gentrification or abandonment and deterioration of an increasing percentage of our housing stock and the growing affordability gap between haves and have nots 8212 require that the Government of the United States seriously address the question of how our society can produce and preserve more housing for more American families in a more rational thoughtful and efficient way in the decade ahead As affordable housing production is increased within the context of healthy inclusive communities the economy is strengthened more

environments nbsp In 2002 USTDA acted quickly to respond to infrastructure priorities and needs within Afghanistan and the other frontline states nbsp In these and other developing and middle income countries around the world USTDA strives to provide specific tailored and results oriented responses designed to lead to greater stability through capacity building commercial development and increased employment As a core priority USTDA facilitates development in emerging markets by promoting U S partnerships in high priority overseas projects nbsp Last year the cumulative dollar value of export sales associated with USTDA supported projects topped 19 billion although that number only tells part of the story nbsp Less directly quantifiable but no less important are the agency s advances in overseas development efforts This year also marks USTDA s first full year in our new headquarters nbsp Located just one half block from our old location the new office provides much needed additional space nbsp It also allows us to better serve U S businesses and foreign delegates on visits to the Washington D C area through our enlarged and improved Business Center and expanded USTDA

Zensheu Chang Opening Postdoc positions Dr Shyh Shiuh Lih Dr Stewart Sherrit The NDEAA lab is involved with a broad range of R D topics as described in the following clickable icons The developed mechanisms are driven by elastic waves mechanical vibrations and or electroactive materials Examples of these mechanisms include ultrasonic and surface acoustic wave motors and piezoelectric pumps that are driven by traveling flexural waves Recently an ultrasonic sonic driller corer USDC was developed and shown to have enormous potential for sampling deep drilling probing sensing and in situ analysis making it a Lab on a Drill In parallel electroactive polymers are being investigated for use as actuators artificial muscles Other technologies that are being explored include Haptic interfaces for robotics and Human Muscle Enhancers high power ultrasound for medical treatment ferroelectric source that generates various radiations and charged particles biomimetic technologies and geophysical probing using elastic waves In addition to planetary applications these devices and mechanisms have potential terrestrial applications for medical commercial and others These efforts involve technical cooperation with scientists and engineers at various universities research institutes medical centers and industry in the USA and internationally This lab has been the subject of

http|| natt|| pnl|| gov|| NATT Home Page Home Conferences Technologies Newsletters Related nbsp Sites nbsp The Northwest Alliance for Transportation Technologies NATT is a partnership working to address national technological challenges by focusing relevant industrial and research capabilities on specific transportation goals This partnership combines the strengths of national laboratories research universities the Boeing Company lightweight metal power to manufacturers with abundant low cost help meet its objectives The Alliance provides a format for these diverse innovative noncompetitive entities to develop solutions for a variety of projects NATT activities are co funded by the industrial participants and the U S Department of Energy s Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies The initial mission is to assist the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles PNGV a Presidential initiative in achieving its goals Our Mission PNGV PARTNERSHIP In 1993 the U S government teamed with the three major domestic automakers Chrysler Ford and General Motors in a partnership to develop technologies necessary to create the motor vehicle of the future The partnership aims to strengthen U S competitiveness by producing a mid sized vehicle with performance and price similar to today s cars but with triple the fuel efficiency greatly reduced emissions and 80 percent recyclability A key to achieving PNGV goals is to reduce the weight of the vehicle by 50 percent Weight reduction will be achieved primarily by using lightweight materials to replace current steel components A lighter vehicle will also enable use of more efficient propulsion systems PNGV faces several obstacles including a lack of low cost lightweight materials and effective manufacturing and joining technologies for these materials Once these obstacles are overcome PNGV will be better positioned to deliver significant environmental energy and economic benefits to the United States Fuel efficient vehicles will lessen our reliance on foreign oil supplies especially as our population continues to grow and more people use motor vehicle transportation Further the U S automobile manufacturing industry is integral to the nation s economy accounting for one in seven U S jobs Technological improvements of this kind will help position U S industry for world leadership WHAT IS NATT NATT is a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory PNNL initiative comprised of multiple regional industrial sectors brought together to improve U S industrial technologies Partners will focus on the research and formulation of advanced cost effective lightweight materials advanced manufacturing processes and prototype or pilot scale development The proposed NATT partnership will include the Boeing Company Northwest lightweight aluminum magnesium and titanium producers other automotive and aerospace suppliers regional electric suppliers such as the Bonneville Power Administration state universities the Big Three auto manufacturers and national laboratories WHY NATT The U S DOE Office of Transportation Technologies has recognized a unique opportunity to ally these Pacific Northwest components to address serious technological challenges Using cost shared government funds these noncompetitive entities can more efficiently work together toward a goal that benefits everyone OBJECTIVES NATT s principal focus is the development of technologies necessary to achieve the 50 percent weight reduction required to meet PNGV s objectives NATT partners will use their resources to design new lightweight metals shaping and connecting techniques and to lower material costs NATT will also work with the domestic transportation industry aerospace vehicular suppliers etc to develop technical tools required to enhance U S competitiveness and benefit a broad range of noncompetitive industrial sectors NATT will be a strategic U S asset addressing the multi disciplinary research and development that traditionally falls between fundamental university research and near term profit oriented industrial research Results of this work will ensure that the U S is a strong player in the world market UNIQUE POSITIONING The Pacific Northwest is well positioned through NATT to contribute to the national vehicle program PNGV The region s attributes include 40 percent of domestic aluminum production future cars will contain 50 percent more aluminum than today s cars Boeing the largest manufacturer of lightweight structures PNNL a broad based national laboratory having significant experience with the auto industry lightweight metals industry and Boeing Large low cost power providers State universities Magnesium and titanium production plants SUMMARY The Northwest Alliance for Transportation Technologies brings together Pacific Northwest entities to meet the considerable challenges facing PNGV The success of NATT s work will be important to the future of our national economy our environment and the Pacific Northwest region Powerpoint Presentation To view a Powerpoint presentation that will provide an overview of the NATT initiative click here nbsp This may take a

Transportation Planning Capacity Building TPCB Program Legal Matters News National Transit Database Performance Plan Welfare to Work nbsp United We Ride Building the Fully Coordinated Human Service Transportation System For most of us getting to work getting to the doctor or getting to church means getting in our car But for many people it s not that easy there are often many challenges that individuals face when trying to get a ride It s not that we governments community organizations haven t tried to help Nearly every human service program recognizes that transportation is important In fact there are 62 federal programs that fund transportation services And we through our taxes and through our charitable contributions are spending a significant amount of money in order to help Ironically for most people who need transportation help the creation of more programs hasn t made getting around much easier We recognize that the key to using these services more efficiently is coordination The Department of Transportation with its partners at the Departments of Health and Human Services Labor and Education are launching United We Ride a new five part initiative to break down the barriers between programs and set the stage for local partnerships that generate common sense solutions and deliver A plus performance for everyone who needs transportation The United We Ride nbsp initiative will include nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp Read More FTA Individualized Marketing Campaign Demonstration Application now available click here The Federal Transit Administration is undertaking a research demonstration program aimed at increasing public transit ridership with a minimal need for new capital investment all the while maintaining people s mobility Called Individualized Marketing the concept has proven successful in Europe and Australia and has shown promising results in Portland Oregon The FTA will be investing federal resources in a partnership with transit agencies in four competitively selected pilot communities in the U S The FTA s pilot project centers around personalized individual marketing of potential commuters who might consider using public transit but need more information Taking transit to the people has proven to be a unique method of boosting ridership without increased spending on infrastructure Utilizing a dialog based technique for promoting the use of public transport the program provides targeted personalized customized marketing tailored for individuals that are most likely to change their travel behavior The FTA will fund contractor support who will perform the Individualized Marketing Pilot in the four selected locations in close coordination and partnership with the transit agencies and local officials of the city area The primary model for this project is the UITP International Public Transportation Association project conducted in Europe The UITP project involved 45 transit agencies from over 15 countries The Switching to Public Transport experiment was very successful in demonstrating that effective individualized marketing can significantly increase the level of ridership bolstering the theory that a new customer consciousness has developed in which people view public transit more favorably and are leaning in the direction of considering transit as the single auto congestion continues to worsen Pilot projects in both Europe and Australia have yielded a reduction in car usage in the area targeted for the project of around 10 while large scale individualized marketing efforts 35 000 population yielded up to 14 reductions results tracked after one and two years A 1999 independent cost benefit analysis of the Perth Australia demonstration project yielded a 1 13 return on investment The first U S pilot project in Portland Oregon yielded a reduction in car travel of 8 in the area selected for the pilot and an increase in travel by environmentally friendly modes in the same area of 27 The one year evaluation of the pilot s success was begun in September 2003 and Portland officials have indicated that if the results hold firm they will consider replicating the process throughout the city Now the FTA is taking the project to four locations in the United States teaming with local transit authorities and local governments that will be selected on a competitive basis to be part of this promising pilot Each location will have unique characteristics to test the true potential of the individualized marketing concept The FTA anticipates that application criteria and procedures will be made available on our website and sent out to interested parties by mid November 2003 Completed applications expressions of interest will be due to the FTA by mid January 2004 CLICK HERE for a background piece that will help explain the concept as presented by International Expert Werner Broeg at the 27th Nottingham Transport Conference If you wish to place your organization on a list for

of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century TEA 21 the law that provides funding for Federal surface transportation programs including transit Pending enactment of a law reauthorizing TEA 21 this 5 month extension of the law will continue to fund surface transportation activities through February 29 2004 As our stakeholders we encourage you to continue your participation in and support of this important legislation As you know it is critical that we pass a six year reauthorization bill this year FTA Administrator Dorn Lauds President Bush for his Commitment to Federal Investment in Public Transportation FTA Administrator Dorn delivered good news to transit stakeholders on Monday February 3 2003 following President Bush s release of his proposed FY 2004 budget Dorn gathered nearly 100 transit advocates together to share specifics of the proposed FTA budget Among the highlights of her remarks Dorn commented that Although the Nation is facing enormous and expensive challenges including fighting terrorism and promoting economic growth the Administration proposes to sustain the record level of Federal investment in public transportation proposed by the President in FY 2003 She added that the FY 2004 budget exceeds the FY 2002 guaranteed funding level by 7 percent Dorn shared that the FY 2004 proposal offers the public transportation community transit operators transit suppliers and most importantly transit riders a budget that Promotes common sense transit solutions Encourages A performance Keeps our commitments and Champions independence and opportunity Detailed information on the FY 2004 FTA budget can be found at FTA FY 2004 Budget Transit in History nbsp b l s g m n k window onerror null bName navigator appName bVer parseInt navigator

research undertaking to expand our understanding of subsurface contaminant fate and transport With more than fifty percent of the U S population depending on groundwater for their drinking water protecting aquifers from contamination is a national priority Responsibility for preventing surface and groundwater contamination is given to several federal agencies the Departments of Energy Interior and Agriculture the Environmental Protection Agency the Army Corps of Engineers among others as well as to state county and municipal agencies Because of a rapidly growing threat of aquifer contamination in our industrialized society each of these organizations needs dramatically improved technology to avert damage to our water supplies The INEEL s Subsurface Science Initiative SSI is a major research undertaking designed to help safeguard our precious groundwater supplies by applying science to a better understanding of subsurface processes and how they control the movement and degradation of contaminants in the subsurface over time The primary motivation for the Subsurface Science Initiative is to develop the scientific basis and new technology needed for the Department of Energy to remediate and monitor sites having radioactive and chemical contaminants in the ground as a result of research to develop weapons and peacetime uses of nuclear energy The SSI effort encompasses a broad range of scientific inquiry including geology geophysics hydrology biology chemistry and computational science to address nationwide environmental management issues A world class review board collaboration with governmental agencies working on groundwater problems and recommendations from the National Research Council guide the INEEL Program Our research focus includes development and validation of predictive models to guide programs aimed at preventing or remediating contamination robust waste contaminant systems to prevent contaminants from reaching groundwater supplies and reliable monitoring systems to provide early warning of problems before extensive damage is done We are developing new research capabilities and recruiting staff to advance subsurface investigations Multidisciplinary research teams are now conducting mesoscale experimental campaigns designed to mimic complex real world hydrological microbiological geochemical and geological subsurface processes nbsp Additionally we are planning a Subsurface Geosciences Laboratory user facility to enable experimental verification of predictive models testing of caps and barriers and development of new monitoring systems and sensors The Subsurface Science Initiative creates an exciting opportunity for scientists engineers and students to work in collaboration with INEEL personnel on cutting edge research into problems whose solutions are important for ensuring a clean safe environment for humanity and all life on earth nbsp Explore the opportunities and promises of the SSI

http|| foia|| fbi|| gov|| FBI Freedom of Information Act Introduction Introduction In early 1975 the FBI assigned a handful of employees the task of handling an anticipated influx of Freedom of Information Act requests due to new legislation Although the Freedom of Information Act had been in effect since 1967 it did not apply to investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes thus generally exempting FBI files from public access By the end of 1975 amendments to the Freedom of Information Act had become effective and the Privacy Act of 1974 also became effective The passage of these laws provided for broad access to FBI records which previously had been severely limited The task of responding to these Freedom of Information Privacy Acts FOIPA requests became a very large one indeed Some single requests have resulted in the processing of thousands of pages of records In very simple terms when a request is received it is logged into a computer and assigned a number for tracking purposes it is acknowledged an indices search is conducted to determine if the FBI has responsive records and the file s is located and reviewed to determine if it is fact quot ident quot or the correct file Once a file has been identified as being responsive to a request it is photocopied and the work copy is reviewed by an analyst to determine if any portions should be withheld from the requester under any various exemptions permitted by the FOIPA The analyst uses a colored marker to delete any exempt material writes in the margins the particular exemption cited and has the work copy re copied using a photocopier with a special filter The portions that appeared in translucent color on the work copy are black on the release copy The release copy is mailed to the requester upon receipt of payment of fees if applicable This labor intensive process has been repeated thousands of times since 1975 In the past twenty plus years the FBI has handled over 300 000 requests and over six million pages of FBI documents have been released to the public in paper format Currently an automated document processing system is under development that will replace the quot marker pen quot method and allow for documents to be released in electronic format For the FOIPA Section web page we have selected several FBI cases which may be of interest to the public These documents also appear in paper form in our traditional reading room in Washington D C As time and resources permit additional cases will be created in electronic format and placed on the web site for public viewing All of these publications are in PDF Portable Document Format To view them you will need to have the Adobe Acrobat Reader plug in installed on your computer The Reader can be downloaded at no cost from Adobe s site on the World Wide Web If you have difficulty accessing any material on this site because of a disability please contact us in writing or via telephone and we will work with you to make the information available Freedom of Information Privacy Act Section 202 324 5520 Reading Room Index Electronic Reading Room Major Information Systems DOJ Reference Guide US DOJ FOIA Search FOIA Home Page FBI Home Page

Dale Alan Cox Highlights Toxic Rainfall in San Joaquin Valley nbsp nbsp USGS Releases Study on Toxic Rainfall in San Joaquin Valley The toxic pesticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos were found in all rainfall samples collected by the U S Geological Survey USGS in the area of Modesto Calif during January and February 2001 storms The concentrations of these two insecticides in the rainfall samples exceeded proposed state guidelines for the protection of aquatic life in most samples by up to a factor of 10 for diazinon and up to a factor of 7 4 for chlorpyrifos Many pesticides become airborne during the application process and can drift off site said Michael Majewski a USGS scientist and expert in atmospheric deposition who contributed to the study After they are applied many pesticides volatilize into the lower atmosphere a process that can continue for days weeks or months after the application depending on the compound In addition pesticides can become airborne attached to wind blown dust Rainfall samples collected during the dormant spray season in Modesto and the surrounding agricultural areas exceeded the state guidelines for diazinon concentrations by an average factor of 5 7 for diazinon and 3 1 for chlorpyrifos Simultaneously storm runoff samples were collected from an urban storm drain where diazinon concentration exceeded the proposed state aquatic life guidelines by an average factor of 9 5 Sixty eight percent of the diazinon concentration found in the storm drain runoff could be accounted for by the concentration in the rainfall Additionally samples were collected from the San Joaquin Merced Stanislaus and Tuolumne rivers and Orestimba Creek during this study Sixty out of a total of 240 of these samples exceeded the proposed state guideline for diazinon and 18 for chlorpyrifos The highest concentrations of diazinon occurred in the San Joaquin River where concentrations exceeded the state guidelines by as much as 3 6 times The highest chlorpyrifos concentrations occurred at Orestimba Creek where samples exceeded the state guidelines by a factor of 3 4 It is important to recognize that the application of these pesticides affect all parts of the hydrologic cycle said the report s lead author USGS scientist Celia Zamora It is during rainfall events that these pesticides get washed out of the atmosphere and produce run off at surprisingly high levels that exceed the guidelines for protection of aquatic life The study will continue through 2004 at six sites in the San Joaquin River Basin and two additional sites in the Sacramento River Basin The complete results of the study will be forthcoming This study was funded by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation to provide additional information to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board for their development of Total Maximum Daily Load regulation for diazinon and chlorpyrifos in the San Joaquin Basin The USGS report entitled

set about what you ve got to do You do your work It was an opportunity to get out there and confront terrorism outside the United States quot FRAUD ALERT Don t be quot Grinched quot this holiday season The last thing anyone needs at this joyous and gift giving time of year is to be cheated by con artists of every stripe online offline and on the other end of your telephone That s why a sleighful of FBI Criminal Investigative experts got together today to outline some of the scams these modern day Grinches may try to pull on you and your loved ones and to offer tips on how you can protect yourselves from becoming victims of fraud this holiday season and throughout the year quot Nearly 2 500 FBI Agents around the country and around the world are working hard to prevent and catch these con artists quot said Grant Ashley who heads up the Bureau s Criminal Investigative Division quot Last year we investigated more than 20 000 fraud cases of all kinds insurance fraud telemarketing fraud securities fraud health care fraud and financial institution fraud Those investigations led to the recovery or restitution of more than 10 billion of fraudulently stolen funds quot Beware of scams like these Fake credit unions Con artists place ads in newspapers for non existent credit unions offering hassle free loans if you wire them a fee of 1 500 Or they have you fill out a loan application and then steal your personal information Debt or mortgage elimination offers The perpetrators of these schemes offer to take advantage of quot loopholes in the system quot that will eliminate your entire mortgage for an up front fee Don t believe it There are no loopholes Phony lotteries Scam artists will notify you that you ve won a lottery but you must send them some money to receive your winnings Sad fact there is no lottery and you never receive a prize Protect yourself and report possible crimes If you come across anyone attempting these or other suspicious activities please report them to your local FBI office or police department A few simple precautions can help keep you from being Grinched Never give personal information over the telephone mail or Internet unless you initiated the contact Shred credit card receipts and old financial statements Protect PIN numbers and passwords Carry a minimum amount of identifying information Do not wire money to strangers quot Fraud can happen anywhere quot said AD Ashley quot on the street at your front door on the telephone or on the computer The best thing individuals can do is be aware If a deal looks like it s too good to be true it probably is quot For more information and more information on the full range of fraudulent schemes go to http www ifccfbi gov index asp or http www fbi gov hq cid fc
